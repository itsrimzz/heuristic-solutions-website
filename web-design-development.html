       <p>Have you ever heard web designers speak out terms like Responsive, Fixed or Liquid? Well you will have no idea about those terms but these are the type of websites that are being made these days. The decision of which type of website needs to be made depends upon usability. This is something really important for any web designer. So letâ€™s check out the three types and why they are called so:</p>
       
<ul class="listed">
<li><strong>Fixed Design:</strong>  In this website design the width is pre-defined and does not change no matter where you view it. It becomes extremely difficult to view the content on a smartphone or tablet because the user has to scroll horizontally to view the rest of the content on a page. They might have to zoom in and zoom out on the page as well. Such kind of website design also has effect on the images.</li>

<li><strong>Liquid or Fluid Design: </strong>In such kind of design the content adjusts itself with the width of the browser. The content column are created using percentages and are not fixed columns this is the reason why columns keep on increasing or decreasing in size relative to each other.</li>

<li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> This design format of a website makes it easier to view in any device. In such kind of design reading and navigating is easier as compared to any other design. This makes it easier for the user as they do not have to resize, pan or scroll through the webpage. The website which has responsive design is easily viewable in laptop, smartphones and tablets. </li>

</ul>
