<p><strong>Important</strong></p>
 
<p>Please check back often as this notice is updated from time to time. Your use of Heuristic Solutions websites means you agree to this privacy notice.</p>

<p><strong>How information collection on our sites works:</strong></p>
 
<p><strong>Meet Edna:</strong> To show how information is collected on our Websites and across the internet, we’ll use Edna as example. Edna will help show one person’s journey on the web, and how we help make her online experience more meaningful and relevant.</p>
 
<p>Edna is a 42 year-old mother of three who lives in a small town on Long Island, New York. Edna likes to shop, research, and read content online, particularly about her gardening hobby. She uses email and social media and enjoys receiving advertising relevant to her interests, so she can learn about new products and ideas. However, Edna is concerned about her privacy and what data and information is collected about her. She often wonders how her computer knows she likes gardening when she sees gardening ads, even when she is not on a website about gardening. The privacy principles below will help Edna and others better understand just that. The principles explain who Heuristic Solutions is and how we collect and use information in connection with the Heuristic Solutions.in Website and Heuristic Solutions Services.</p>
 
<p><strong>Heuristic Solutions.in Website Privacy Practices</strong></p>
 
<p>Before we get detailed on our privacy practices, we want to point out that we collect data in two different ways. This section talks about our data collection and use practices for this Website; later we will talk about data collection and use via services provided on behalf of our clients.</p>
 
<p>Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information (information that doesn’t identify you by name): When Edna goes to www.HeuristicSolutions.in, we automatically gather non-personal information (also known as non-PII) by placing a cookie,  or number, on her device. We do this to help understand what parts of our website Edna enjoys most. This allows us to improve with content that Edna prefers for future visits. We do not automatically collect or use any of Edna’s personally identifiable information (PII) when she visits www.heuristicsolutions.in.</p>
 
<p>Collection and use of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)?  We only use PII when a user voluntarily provides it. There are a few instances where we may collect PII from Edna. But, we never collect PII without consent and never use PII in advertising or marketing placements. Examples where Edna or other users might voluntarily provide PII include:</p>

 
<strong>Responding to Edna's requests: we keep a record of information, including email address and other PII solely for responding to a user’s request. For example:</strong>
<ul>
<li>If Edna clicks on the “contact us” link and submits a question or comment, we will collect her name, email address, and phone number in order to send her a reply.</li>
<li>If Edna voluntarily asks to be added to our newsletter list, we would collect her email address to send her our email newsletter.</li>
<li><strong>Purchases:</strong> If Edna were to purchase or subscribe to Heuristic Solutions services for a fee via HeuristicSolutions.in, information collected such as payment information would only be used for processing payment.</li>
 </ul>
 
 
<p><strong>How to manage information we have about you and your HeuristicSolutions.in subscriptions.</strong></br> If at any time Edna decides she would like us to remove her from our marketing e-mails or newsletters, unsubscribe from our database, or if she’d like to change or correct any contact information, she can contact us at privacy@HeuristicSolutions.in. She must include her name, email address, and clear instructions regarding changes she is requesting. She may also unsubscribe from email newsletters by clicking on the “<strong>unsubscribe</strong>” link found at the bottom of the email.</p>
 
<p><strong>About Cookie use and similar technologies on Heuristic Solutions.in:</strong> </br>When Edna uses our Website, she is providing consent for our use of cookies. Heuristic Solutions uses cookies, pixels and similar technologies to collect Non-PII about your visits to our Website.</p>
  
<p>A cookie is a file placed on a user’s browser that uniquely identifies browser and device. Cookies allow us to customize Edna’s website experience to include more content she likes, and less content she may find not useful. If Edna does not agree to our use of cookies, she may prevent their use through her browser settings, elect not to use this Website, or just opt out of cookies on our Website as described below. By opting out, Edna may not be able to use certain Website features or take full advantage of all offerings.</p>
 
<p>Sometimes a cookie resides on Edna’s device for just the single time she’s visiting our website; this is called a session cookie.  Sometimes a cookie remains on Edna’s device until she deletes it; this is called a persistent cookie.  Both types of cookies may be used on our Website.  Cookies help us analyze how users like Edna use our Website by telling us the pages viewed. They also tell us about the number of visitors to the Website and the webpages that referred them. The Google Analytics cookie we use is an example of a persistent cookie.</p>
 
<p><strong>Heuristic Solutions uses the following cookies:</strong></p>
 
<p><strong>Performance/Analytics/Tracking:</strong> This type of cookie provides aggregated information about where a user may go on the Website.</p>
 <ul>
 
<li>Google Analytics. Heuristic Solutions uses Google Analytics to help us analyze how visitors use the Website. Among other things, Google Analytics uses cookies to collect information about the number of visits to the Website, the webpage that referred visitors to the Website, language, device, browser and operating system, the pages visitors view within the Website and other similar details. We do not share this information with third parties. When used this way the Google Analytics cookie is a persistent cookie, and will remain on your device until the cookie expires or you delete it. These cookies may appear as _utma, _utmb, _utmc, _utmz, _utmv, _utmt.</li>
<li>We also use> Google Analytics as a session cookie. This cookie may appear as has_js. We do not retain this data as it is deleted upon closing of your browser, and therefore we cannot share it with any third parties.</li>
</ul>


 
<p><strong>Social media/Sharing:</strong> These are cookies that help with the Website’s functionality. These are third party cookies, and they allow you to share comments, pages, bookmarks, and likes, and help to provide access to social networking tools easily.</p>
 
<p>Social media widgets used on this Website include LinkedIn, Twitter, and YouTube. These social media widgets collect information about your visit to the Website and your use of the social platform services (for example, buttons or likes) on the Website. We do not share information with these social platforms, however please keep in mind the social networks collect the data of your site visit and interaction with the social widget directly.</p>
 
<p>Opt out of cookies placed from visits to heuristicsolutions.in. You can also change your browser settings to prevent cookies.</p>
 
<p><strong>Does Heuristic Solutions.in share any information with other vendors or partners?</strong><br/> If permitted by law, we may provide access to a user’s PII and/or Non-PII to our vendors and contractors (also known as third parties) who are performing services on our behalf. For example, if Edna uses a credit card to subscribe to a service, we may securely share her credit card information with our credit card processing service to transact her payment. These vendors are not permitted to use this information for any other purpose. <strong>The Heuristic Solutions Site uses social media widgets including, but not limited to, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn so users can easily share information about their visits with “likes” or “shares.” Always review the privacy policy of social media sites as their data collection practices are separate from Heuristic Solution’s practices.</strong> Additionally, we must disclose a user’s information when we believe we’re legally obligated to, or in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding prohibited activities, such as incidents of hacking, misuse, or other prohibited activities.</p>
 
<p><strong>Use of this site by Children & Children’s data:</strong><br/> We’re sensitive to children's privacy. Our Website is not developed for or directed at children under age 13. We specifically request that children not provide personal information (PII) through our Website. If a user believes her child provided PII and would like it deleted from our database, she can contact us at privacy@HeuristicSolutions.in. Likewise, if we become aware we’ve collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, we’ll delete it on our own.</p>

 <p><strong>Data retention and storage:</strong><br/> Our Website visitors should know we may use cookie information for advertising purposes for up to 13 months, and summary reports with cookie information may be kept longer. However, if he/she has opted out or chosen not to share information we will not collect it in the first place.</p>
 
<p><strong>Information Security:</strong> Maintaining the privacy of our user’s information is very important to us which means we take care and pay special attention to our security measures to protect user information from data breaches. We follow industry standards to protect against the unauthorized access to, retention of, and disclosure of information. This includes necessary physical, electronic, and management activities to protect information integrity, access, and use.  Any information stored on our servers is treated as confidential. But please do keep in mind no matter what we do to ensure safety, no transmission over the internet is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security. Because of this, we ask that our users are aware of with whom they share their information, and what information they share.</p>
 
<p><strong>Linking to other websites/Third party sites:</strong> A link from our Website to another website does not imply our endorsement of affiliates or websites, and we do not control third party websites to which we link, nor assume responsibility for their content or privacy policies. Once you follow a link to another website, the Heuristic Solutions Privacy Notice no longer applies. It’s important to always read the privacy policy of any website you are visiting.</p>
 
<p><strong>Transfer of data upon change of control:</strong> Users should be aware that in the event that another company acquires all or substantially all of the assets of our business through a consolidation, merger, asset purchase, or other transaction, including as part of a corporate reorganization of bankruptcy proceeding, we reserve the right to transfer all information (including any PII a user may have provided through the “contact us” page) that is in our possession or under our control to the acquiring party.</p>
 
<p><strong>Heuristic Solutions Services Privacy Practices</strong></p>
 
<p><em>This section outlines services we provide for our clients. It concerns data collection and use on such sites (not HeuristicSolutions.in), in conjunction with our services for clients. This information is not related to what happens on HeuristicSolutions.in. It’s important you always review the privacy policy of any site you visit as practices vary.</em></p>
 
<p><strong>What Does Heuristic Solutions do? What does Heuristic Solutions mean by their Services?</strong></p>
 
<p>Heuristic Solutions is a leading global media investment and media agency holding company. We focus on media buying and media strategy, and we continually evaluate innovative ways to deliver relevant advertising and custom online experiences on behalf of our clients. Protecting online user privacy in the course of our business is a priority and one we take very seriously. Heuristic Solutions provides client services such as media planning and buying; marketing communications planning; campaign analytics and research; paid search placement and search engine optimization; and branded entertainment and sports sponsorships (“Services”).</p>
 
<p><strong>Don’t get it? Allow us to explain a bit more about our Services, how information is collected and used, and how you can opt out should you choose to do so.</strong></p>
 
<p>Interest Based Advertising (IBA)</p>
 
<p>Remember Edna and her gardening hobby? With Interest Based Advertising (IBA) technology, (also known as behavioral advertising or audience buying), Edna will see more gardening ads online because she visits many gardening websites and reads a lot of online content about gardening. If our client is a Brand that sells gardening tools, Heuristic Solution’s Services will help place ads on sites where people who like gardening, like Edna, will see them.</p>
 
<p>When Edna visits websites, watches videos online, or clicks on ads, we store a number on her browser using a “cookie” to remember her visits.  Accomplished with partners (digital publishers such as online gardening magazines, for example), this cookie (number) will never collect personal information (PII) about Edna, similar to how explained above.  More on this a bit later…</p>
 
<p>Because many websites Edna visits are related to gardening, the anonymous number which identifies her machine or device is put in the “gardening enthusiast” interest category. As a result, we may show Edna ads that are relevant to gardening enthusiasts as she browses websites. This is how we use information collected about Edna through the cookie (number). Remember the cookie does not tell us who Edna is specifically. All we know is that someone used that particular device to view a gardening website. We tag the device with the cookie so we can later serve more gardening ads to that device.</p>
 
<p><strong>NO PERSONAL INFORMATION is collected for IBA. So whatdowe collect?</strong></p>
 
<p>Through the process described above, we do not collect any of her PII and do not know Edna’s name or any other personal information. We simply recognize the cookie (number) stored in her browser which tells us someone likes gardening websites. We then show Edna ads related to interests in gardening and based on inferred demographics associated with gardening. We will never show ads based on sensitive information categories such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation, health, or sensitive financial categories.</p>
 
<p><strong>Sharing this information and how online advertising works:</strong></p>
 
<p>Edna’s Non-Personal information (non-PII) collected through our Services (or ads placed by us on behalf of clients) may be shared with our clients and vendors. This is essentially how we do business and is how online advertising works. By sharing Edna’s Non-PII with our clients and vendors, the information helps them deliver more tailored ads to potential customers. The non-personal information allows clients to best understand what ads Edna likes most based on how she interacts with the ads and when. This also enables serving of personalized ads to Edna’s devices so she sees ads relevant to her interests, hobbies and things she may be shopping for at the moment. This information also helps clients formulate more efficient ad campaigns which can help Edna in the long run. We do not collect PII via our clients’ ads, except in instances where consent is given by you or you provide the PII voluntarily, and therefore, we do not sell, rent, or share personal information collected on HeuristicSolutions.in or other websites with anyone other than as set forth in this Privacy Notice.</p>
 
<p><strong>What to do when you prefer not to share your non-personal information – how to “opt out”</strong></p>
 
<p><strong>Opting out of Interest Based Advertising (IBA) is different from opting out of cookies from HeuristicSolutions.in as described above under the section about our “Website”.</strong></p>
 
</p>While Edna really enjoys receiving ads relevant to her gardening interests, if she, for some reason, chooses to stop sharing certain non-personal information for targeting advertising, she can “opt out” of some cookie, or number, placement. If she opts out, it does not mean Edna will stop receiving ads altogether. It only means she’ll stop receiving ads tied to her interests. Edna has a few options on how she may opt out. One option would be to adjust her browser settings to block third party cookies. She can learn how to do this by viewing the Browser “help” menu. In addition, she can go to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s, (DAA), Consumer Choice page, http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ where Edna will be able to opt out of allowing the companies listed on such site to place a cookie, or number, on her device. Edna needs to remember that if she opts out by clearing her browser cache or by resetting her cookies; she will have to take these steps from time to time, to opt out again.</p>
 
<p>Heuristic Solutions is an active member of the Digital Advertising Alliance and complies fully with the DAA Self-Regulatory Principles.</p>
